# Style Guide

## Basic English
e.g. and i.e. rather than eg. and ie. except at the start of a sentence, where "For example," and "That is," should be used.

"Right" is only used for the direction. "Correct" is used instead.

## Dates and Times
Do not use the 12-hour clock. Use the 24 hour clock without a separator: 2030 not 20:30 or 20.30.
Short dates should be ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD with leading zeroes.
Long dates are dd (with ordinal) MMMM YYYY: 08th February 2023.
Academic years as YYYY/YY with a slash: 2023/24 not 2023-24 or 2023/4.

## Spelling
Zeroes with an 'e' not zeros.
Focused with one 's' rather than focussed.
